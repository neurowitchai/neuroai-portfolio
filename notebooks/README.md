## 📁 Featured Notebook: Vehicle Classifier

**🧠 Type:** Supervised Learning · Classification  
**📂 Topic:** Computer Vision, ML Fundamentals  
**🪄 Creator:** NeuroWitchAI

This beginner-friendly notebook introduces the concept of supervised learning through a visual and interactive project: training a simple model to classify images of vehicles using flashcards.

🔍 **What you'll learn:**
- How supervised learning works using features and labels
- How to create a simple dataset from image folders
- How to extract visual features using color histograms
- How to train a Random Forest classifier
- How to evaluate performance and handle small datasets

📌 Great for:
- AI beginners
- Educators and content creators
- NeuroAI students learning the foundations of machine learning

📸 **Try it yourself:**  
Add your own labeled vehicle images to expand the dataset and improve accuracy—or apply the same structure to classify other objects.
