# 🧠 NeuroAI Portfolio by NeuroWitch

Welcome to my NeuroAI portfolio — a space where neuroscience meets artificial intelligence, creativity meets code, and curiosity fuels every experiment.

## 🔬 Focus Areas
- **NeuroAI**: Brain-inspired models, cognitive architectures, biologically plausible learning
- **Women’s Brain Health**: Research and tools focused on hormonal cycles, neurological disorders, and underserved populations
- **Learning in Public**: From textbooks to TikToks, I’m building, sharing, and growing — one neuron at a time
